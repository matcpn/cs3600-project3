Milestone README

Our approach for the milestone was to set up the data structures for the header. We made a barebones struct for the header that had all of the bitfields set correctly to how big the unsigned ints needed to be to be thrown together for the header. We then created a scalable and concise helper function for parsing the arguments. We planned on doing the extra credit, so we added in if clauses and statements for that too, but we won't be touching them today. 

To parse the arguments we had a few disagreements on how to structure and design the functions that would be doing dynamic allocation, as we were thinking in different mindsets. We ended up agreeing on one way over another arbitrarily as both the solutions we would think of would work, with just about the same amount of work. 

We then took a break to prepare dinner and to eat snacks.
